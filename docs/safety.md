# Safety & Ethics

## Positioning
- This is **supportive** and **psychoeducation** oriented.
- It must not claim to replace professional care.

## Disclaimers (must show)
- “Not a substitute for professional medical advice.”
- “If you are in immediate danger or thinking about self-harm, contact local emergency services.”

## Crisis handling
- Detect signals for self-harm, suicide, imminent violence, or abuse.
- Response pattern:
  1. Acknowledge + validate
  2. Encourage contacting real-world help now
  3. Present hotline/resources + “call”/“text” buttons (where feasible)
  4. Offer grounding while they seek help

## Guardrails
- Avoid prompting the user to relive trauma in graphic detail.
- Prefer short interventions, consent checks, and user control.
- Provide an “exit” button to stop the exercise and return to neutral.

## Logging policy
- Avoid logging content by default.
- If debugging logs are needed: strip message bodies, keep only timings + error codes.
